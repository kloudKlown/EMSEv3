  Abstract                 = {Surprisingly, console logs rarely help operators detect
problems in large-scale datacenter services, for they often
consist of the voluminous intermixing of messages
from many software components written by independent
developers. We propose a general methodology to mine
this rich source of information to automatically detect
system runtime problems. We first parse console logs
by combining source code analysis with information retrieval
to create composite features. We then analyze
these features using machine learning to detect operational
problems. We show that our method enables analyses
that are impossible with previous methods because of
its superior ability to create sophisticated features. We
also show how to distill the results of our analysis to
an operator-friendly one-page decision tree showing the
critical messages associated with the detected problems.
We validate our approach using the Darkstar online game
server and the Hadoop File System, where we detect numerous
real problems with high accuracy and few false
positives. In the Hadoop case, we are able to analyze 24
million lines of console logs in 3 minutes. Our methodology
works on textual console logs of any size and requires
no changes to the service software, no human input,
and no knowledge of the software’s internals.},

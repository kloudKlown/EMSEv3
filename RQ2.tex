\subsection*{RQ2: Is there a relationship between log changes and effort spent on bug fixes?}


\subsubsection*{Motivation}

In RQ1, we find that logs are more likely to be changed in bug fixes. However, we do not know whether changing logs has a relationship with effort spent on bug fixes. If changing logs during bug fixes has relationship with the effort of bug fixes, developers may consider leveraging and improving logs during bug fixes in order to save effort.

\subsubsection*{Approach}


To answer the research question, 

To study whether there is a relationship between effort spent on bug fixes and changing logs during bug fixes, we collect all JIRA issues with type \emph{bug} from the three studied systems. We obtained the code commits for each of these JIRA issues by searching for the issue id from commit messages. We then separate the JIRA issues into (1) bugs that are fixed with log churn and (2) bugs that are fixed without log churn. We calculate the log churn metrics for each bug. If a issue has multiple commits we calculate the log churn metrics for each commit individually. We then measure effort of bug fixes using the time taken to resolve a bug, the number of developers involved during the resolution of a bug and the number of discussion posts about the bug on JIRA. Prior research has shown that such metrics are good estimates of developer effort~\cite{amor2006effort}. 

%:\ian{check the paper that you cite to build a model to predict resolution time to see whether there is any thing you can back up for the choice of these three metrics}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Resolution time:} This metric measures how fast the bug is fixed. This metric is defined as the time taken from when the bug is opened until it is resolved. For example, if a bug was opened on 1$ ^{st}$ February 2015 and closed on 5$ ^{th}$ February 2015, the resolution time of the bug is four days. 
	
	\item \textbf {\# of comments:} This metric measures how much discussion is needed to fix a bug. Intuitively, the more discussion in an issue report, the more effort is spent on fixing the bug. We count the total number of comments in the discussion of each issue report.
	
	\item \textbf {\# of developers:} This metric measures the number of developers who participate in the discussion of fixing the bug. Intuitively, more developers who discuss the bug, more effort is spent on fixing the bug. We count the number of unique developers who comment on the issue report. We use the user names in the JIRA discussion to identify the developers. 
\end{enumerate}
Intuitively, a complex bug fix might have more code churn and in turn takes longer time to be resolved, more developers being involved and more discussions on JIRA. Therefore, we use code churn to normalize the resolution time, the number of comments, and the number of developers during bug fixes. We use these normalized effort metrics to find if there is statistically significant difference between bug fixes with log churn and bug fixes without log churn. We use the {\em MannWhitney U} test to find the $|\rho|$ values and \textsl{Cohen's d} test to measure the effect size, similar to RQ1. 

%We use the code churn to measure the complexity of the issue. 


 %and the code churn for fixing each issue We then extracted three metrics from JIRA issues to measure the effort of fixing a bug:

%Prior research has shown that complexity of software can be measured using different metrics, including source lines of code change~\cite{complexity}.

\subsubsection*{Results}

\textbf{We find that the log changes are more likely to occur during more complex bugs fixes}. We find that the average code churn for fixing bugs is significantly higher with log churn than without log churn (see Table~\ref{tab:bugfixes} and Figure~\ref{fig:figure3}). This suggests that complex bug fixes are more likely to have log churn (statically significant with non-trivial effect size). 

\textbf{We find that bugs that are fixed with log churn, take shorter time with fewer comments and fewer people.} After normalizing the code churn, we find that the resolution time, the number of comments and the number of developers are all statistically significantly smaller in the bug fixes with log churn than the ones without log churn. This result suggests that given two bugs of the same complexity, the one with log churn is likely to take less time to get resolved and likely to need a fewer number of developers involved with fewer discussions. Changing logs may provide useful information to assist developers in discussing, diagnosing and fixing bugs. For example, when fixing bug HBASE-3074\footnote{https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-30741}, developers left the first comment to provide additional details in the log about where the failure occurs. Developers add the name of the servers into the the logs. Such additional data helps diagnose the cause of the failure and helps fix the bug.

\subsubsection*{Discussion}

\hypobox{Logs are more likely to be changed during fixing more complex bugs. After normalizing the complexity of bugs using code churn, we find that bug fixes with log churn are resolved faster with fewer people and fewer discussions.}

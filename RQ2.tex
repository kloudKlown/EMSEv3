\subsection*{\textbf{RQ2: Is there a relationship between log changes and resolution time of bug fixes?}}


\subsubsection*{\textbf{Motivation}}

In RQ1, we find that logs are changed more frequently in bug fixes. However, we do not know if leveraging and changing logs is beneficial during bug fixes. To answer this, we look at the  effort spent to fix the bug. We measure effort spent based on the time taken to resolve a bug, the number of developers involved during the resolution of a bug and the number of discussions posts on JIRA. We try to find whether there is a relationship between resolution time, developer involvement and log churn during bug fixes. 


\subsubsection*{\textbf{Approach}}

To find out whether there is a relationship between log churn and resolution time of bug fixes, we collect all JIRA issues with type `bug' from the three studied systems. We obtained the code commits for each of these JIRA issues by searching for the issue id from the commit messages. We identify the log churn, and the code churn for fixing each issue. We then split the JIRA issues into (1) bugs that are fixed with log churn and (2) bugs that are fixed without log churn. We use the code churn to measure the complexity of the issue. We then extracted three metrics from JIRA issues to measure the effort of fixing a bug:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Resolution time:} This metric measures how fast the bug is fixed. This metric is defined as the time taken from when the bug is opened until it is resolved. For example, if a bug was opened on 1$ ^{st}$ February 2015 and closed on 5$ ^{th}$ February 2015, the resolution time of the bug is four days. 
	
	\item \textbf {\# of comments:} This metric measures how much discussion is needed to fix a bug. Intuitively, the more discussion in an issue report, the more effort is spent on fixing the bug. We count the total number of comments in the discussion of each issue report.
	
	\item \textbf {\# of developers:} This metric measures the number of developers who participate in the discussion of fixing the bug. Intuitively, more developers who discuss the bug, more effort is spent on fixing the bug. We count the number of unique developers who comment on the issue report. We use the user names in the JIRA discussion to identify the developers. 
\end{enumerate}

Prior research has shown that complexity of software can be measured using different metrics, including source lines of code change~\cite{complexity}. Intuitively, a complex bug fix might have more code churn and in turn takes longer time to be resolved, more developers being involved and more discussions on JIRA. Therefore, we use code churn to normalize the resolution time, the number of comments, and the number of developers  during bug fixes. We use these normalized effort metrics to find if there is statistically significant difference between bug fixes with log churn and bug fixes without log churn. We use the {\em MannWhitney U} test to find the $|\rho|$ values and \textsl{Cohen's d} test to measure the effect size, similar to RQ1. 


\begin{table*}
	\caption{Comparing code and developer metrics between the bug fixes with log churn and bug fixes without log churn. The p-value is from MannWhitney U tests and the effect sizes are calculated using Cohen's d. P-values are smaller than 0.05 and negative effect size implies that metrics for bug fixes without log churn have higher values.}

\subsubsection*{\textbf{Results}}

\textbf{We find that the logs changes are more likely to occur during complex bugs fixes}. We find that the average code churn for fixing bugs is significantly higher with log churn than without log churn (see Table~\ref{tab:bugfixes} and Figure~\ref{fig:figure3}). This suggests that complex bug fixes are more likely to have log churn (statically significant with non-trivial effect size). 




\textbf{We find that bugs that are fixed with log churn, take shorter time with fewer comments and fewer people.} After normalizing the code churn, we find that the resolution time, the number of comments and the number of developers are all statistically significantly smaller in the bug fixes with log churn than the ones without log churn. This result suggests that given two bugs of the same complexity, the one with log churn usually take less time to get resolved and needs a fewer number of developers involved with fewer discussions. Changing logs may provide useful information to assist developers in discussing, diagnosing and fixing bugs. For example, when fixing bug HBASE-3074\footnote{https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-30741}, developers left the first comment to provide additional details in the log about where the failure occurs. In the source code, developers add the name of the servers into the the logs. Such additional data helps diagnose the cause of the failure and helps fix the bug.

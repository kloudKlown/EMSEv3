	\indent Logging is a practice used by software developers to record and convey
	information during the execution of a system. Logs can be used to
	output the behavior of the system when running, to monitor the choke
	points of a system, and to help in debugging the system.
	
	Though much research has been done on the analysis of logs, most of
	the studies looked at either characterizing logs based on their usage
	or how to improve logs so they are more meaningful. But, there has
	been no study so far which looks into how effective logs are in the
	software development process and especially in debugging. 
	
	To answer this question in our paper we first try to find co-relation
	between log updates and bug fixes. This is an intuitive step, because
	when developers fix bugs they update the logs associated with the
	bug or add new logs to help them fix bugs. We verify this claim on
	3 large scale systems like Hadoop, HDFS and Qpid from the Apace Foundation.
	We then find the types of changes developers make to logging statements
	during bug fixes. Finally, we look at how long it takes for bugs to get fixed,
	the number of developers involved in the fix and the comments associated
	with the fixes, all with respect to bugs without logging changes.\\
	\indent We find that in all projects logging actually helps in the debugging
	process and three factors - time, developers and comments - are lesser
	when bugs have log churn associated with them. This demonstrates the
	importance logs play in bug fixes and motivates developers to log
	more.

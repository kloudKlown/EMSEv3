    	abstract = {We consider some nonnormal regression situations in which there are many regressor variables, and it is desired to determine good fitting models, according to the value of the likelihood ratio statistic for tests of submodels against the full model. Efficient computational algorithms for the normal linear model are adopted for use with nonnormal models. Even with as many as 10-15 regressor variables present, we find it is often possible to determine all of the better fitting models with relatively small amounts of computer time. The use of the procedures is illustrated on exponential, Poisson and binary regression models.},

  Abstract                 = {Surprisingly, console logs rarely help operators detect
problems in large-scale datacenter services, for they often
consist of the voluminous intermixing of messages
from many software components written by independent
developers. We propose a general methodology to mine
this rich source of information to automatically detect
system runtime problems. We first parse console logs
by combining source code analysis with information retrieval
to create composite features. We then analyze
these features using machine learning to detect operational
problems. We show that our method enables analyses
that are impossible with previous methods because of
its superior ability to create sophisticated features. We
also show how to distill the results of our analysis to
an operator-friendly one-page decision tree showing the
critical messages associated with the detected problems.
We validate our approach using the Darkstar online game
server and the Hadoop File System, where we detect numerous
real problems with high accuracy and few false
positives. In the Hadoop case, we are able to analyze 24
million lines of console logs in 3 minutes. Our methodology
works on textual console logs of any size and requires
no changes to the service software, no human input,
and no knowledge of the softwares internals.},

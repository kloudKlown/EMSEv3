In this section, we describe our methodology for preparing the data to answer our research questions.

The aim of this paper is to understand how logs are changed during bug fixes and its relation to resolution time. We conduct a case study on three open source platform software, i.e., \textsl{Hadoop, HBase} and \textsl{Qpid}. All three platform softwares have extensive logging in their source code. Table~\ref{tba:Overview} highlights the overview of the three platform softwares.

{\textbf{Hadoop}\footnote[1]{http://hadoop.apache.org/}}: \emph{Hadoop} is an open source software framework for distributed storage and processing of big data on clusters. \emph{Hadoop} uses the MapReduce data-processing paradigm. The logging characteristics of \emph{Hadoop} have been extensively studied in prior research~\cite{EMSEIAN,JGLouMining,ConsoleLogs}. We study the changes to logs from \emph{Hadoop} releases $0.16.0$ to $2.0$.


{\textbf{HBase}\footnote[2]{http://hbase.apache.org/}}: \emph{HBase} is a distributed, scalable, big data software, which uses \emph{Hadoop} file-systems. We study the changes to logs in \emph{HBase} from release $0.10$ to $0.98.2.RC0$. This covers more than four years of development in \emph{HBase} from 2010 to 2014.

{\textbf{Qpid}\footnote[3]{https://qpid.apache.org}}: \emph{Qpid} is an open source messaging platform that implements an Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). We study \emph{Qpid} release $0.10$ to release $0.30$ that are from 2011 till 2014.


Figure~\ref{tba:Overview} shows a general overview of our approach, which consists of four steps: (1) We mine the Git repository of each studied system to extract all commits and identify the bug fixes and non-bug fixes. (2) We identify log changes in both bug fixes and non-bug fixes. (3) We categorize the log changes into \textsl{`New logs', `Modified Logs'} and \textsl{`Deleted logs'}. (4) We calculate churn metrics for each category and use statistical tool R~\cite{ihaka1996r}, to perform experiments on the data to answer our research questions.  In the reminder of this section we describe the first three steps.

%We used Apache software versioning system, SVN to collect the commit
%history for all the projects in our case study. We used JIRA to collect
%the buggy reports for all the projects in our case study. We extracted
%the reports in XML format for parsing convenience. 


\subsection{Study Approach}

In this section we present the approach of our case study. 
%We use Git to study the evolution of Java source code in the three subject systems. 
%%similar to C-REX ~\cite{HassanPHD} and J-REX ~\cite{WCSEIan}. 
%We extract the changes in each commit and use this data to calculate the metrics to answer our research questions.

\subsubsection{Extracting bug fixes and non-bug fixes}

The first step in our approach is to extract commits associated with bug fixes and non-bug fixes. First, we extract a list of all commits from the Git repository of each project. To avoid the branching and merging commits, we enable the `no-merges' option in the Git \textsl{log} command. This flattens all the changes made to file in different branches but only exclude the merge between branch and trunk. We also filter the non-Java and `test' files present in the commits. 

Next, we extract a list of all the JIRA issues that have the type `bug'. Developers often mention the JIRA issue ID's in the commit messages. We search JIRA issue IDs in the commit messages to identify all the bug fixes. We exclude commits which do not have JIRA IDs because we cannot extract developer metrics for those issues. 

\subsubsection{Identifying log changes}


To identify the log changes in the datasets, we first manually explore logs in the source code. Some logs are specific to a particular project. For example, a log from Qpid invokes `QPID\_LOG' to print logs as follows: 
\hypobox{ QPID\_LOG(error, ``Rdma: Cannot accept new connection (Rdma exception):
	'' + e.what());
	}

Some logs leverage logging libraries to print logs. For example, \textsl{Log4j}\footnote{http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/} is used widely in \emph{Hadoop} and \emph{HBase}. In both projects, logs have a method invocation `LOG', followed by logging-level. The following log uses \textsl{Log4j}:
\hypobox{ LOG.debug(``public AsymptoticTestCase(String''+ name +``) called'')}

Using regular expressions to match these logs, we automate the process of finding all the logs in the studied projects.


\subsubsection{Identifying new, modified and deleted logs}

Since, Git \textsl{diff} does not provide a feature to track modification to the code, modifications to a log is shown as a deletion followed by an addition. To track these added and deleted logs we used Levenshtein ratio~\cite{Levenshtein2}. For every pair of added or deleted logs in a commit, we compare the text in parenthesis after removing the logging method (e.g, LOG ) and the log level (e.g, info). We calculate the Levenshtein ratio between the added and deleted log similar to prior research~\cite{levenshteinratio}. We consider a pair of added and deleted log as a modification if they have a Levenshtein ratio of 0.6 or higher. For example, the logs shown below have Levenshtein ratio of 0.86. Hence such a log churn is categorized as a log modification.  
\hypobox{+      LOG.debug(``Call: " +method.getName()+`` took "+ callTime + ``ms");\\ 
	-        LOG.debug(``Call: " +method.getName()+ `` " + callTime);} 

If an added or deleted log has a levenshtein ratio higher than 0.6, we consider the pair of added and deleted logs with the highest levenshtein ratio as a log modification. After identifying all log modifications we identify three categories of logs in a commit namely `newly added logs', `deleted logs' and `modified logs'.
